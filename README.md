# Cypress BDD POM Project

This project demonstrates how to use Cypress for end-to-end testing with a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach and the Page Object Model (POM). It combines Cypress's powerful testing framework with the clarity of Gherkin syntax and the maintainability of the Page Object Model.

# Introduction

This project uses Cypress to write automated tests for web applications. By integrating BDD practices with Gherkin syntax and utilizing the Page Object Model, it provides a robust framework for writing and organizing tests that are both readable and maintainable.

# Features

- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Write tests using Gherkin syntax for clear and descriptive test scenarios.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Organize page interactions and elements into page objects to promote reusability and maintainability.
- **Cypress Integration:** Utilize Cypress for fast, reliable end-to-end testing with a rich set of features and a modern testing framework.
